"""
WLED Button Controller for Raspberry Pi
---------------------------------------

This script allows a Raspberry Pi to communicate with a WLED device (running on an ESP8266 or ESP32)
to control a strip of addressable LEDs. The Raspberry Pi reads a physical button input on GPIO pin 18.
When the button is pressed, the script triggers a green flashing pattern on the LEDs, then returns them
to white. It also includes logic for reconnecting to the WLED device if the connection fails.

Hardware Requirements:
    - Raspberry Pi (any model)
    - A physical push-button wired between GPIO 18 and GND
    - A WLED device (ESP8266/ESP32) with addressable LEDs
    - Network connectivity between Raspberry Pi and WLED device

Usage Steps:
    1. Connect the button to GPIO 18 and GND on the Raspberry Pi.
    2. Set the WLED_IP variable below to match your WLED deviceâ€™s IP address.
    3. Run this script on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., 'python3 wled_button_controller.py').
    4. Press the button to trigger the flashing sequence.

Important Notes:
    - The script uses the 'requests' library to send HTTP requests to the WLED device.
    - The script uses 'RPi.GPIO' to handle GPIO operations on the Raspberry Pi.
    - Logging is configured to use a rotating file log: /var/log/wled_button.log
    - If connection to the WLED device is lost, it will repeatedly attempt reconnection.
